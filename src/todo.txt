Next steps are 

1. adding footer content and theme * done
2. fixing grid background responsivness and making mobile friendly - created xd prototypes
*now I just need to figure out the break points and make the design shift for mobile. * responsive text for logo (not img) since less than 16px is illigible.

-fixed image size (added min height) - now make responsive - breakpoints, adobe xd draft

3. functionality (links, form)

4. optional could be downloading some royalty free images and recreating the hero and contact backgrounds? *done.


**** priority should be recreating background images since these need to be HD if they're blown up, keep the feel, make it look nice. Greyscale? *done

778 * 1024 switch to tablet/mobile.

-padding for about section 
- alignment for contact section 
*set overflow to none for hero and contact p to see which is causing horizontal scroll.

-grid for hero section?? *columns not grid (w flow direction instead of z direction)
- menu for nav + font size
-overflow on contact section -> padding?

wordpress cms & gravity forms



redirect domain with cpanel: https://www.robquin.co.nz:2083/cpsess4653581040/frontend/paper_lantern/mime/redirect.html

25/05/2021
-destructured/cleaned everything
using GetForm for the form, set this up as a component with state hook, test and then redirect domain.
https://docs.getform.io/integrations/gatsby/ 

Working, need to create thank you model on state change

*timer so it goes up and then toggles again.

*form animation -> prototype some basic resonses in xd and transfer to vsc
27/05/2021
-need to figure out how setTimer/state in hooks works (useEffect) so I can get
message to go transparent again after 3s.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html 

28/05/2021 
-try useEffect instead of function
-done, now add form function back, test, switch email and redirect!

29/05/2021
-form working, added required tags and added function back
-added basic privacy statment, now i need to update navigation buttons so user can get back to homepage

*this means I need to get current page location in nav
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/ 
https://reach.tech/router/api/Link 

https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/location-data-from-props/ 

-location data passed through pages -> layout -> nav, now the only trouble is scroll position changing when I'm linking to div id's

* done - nav and footer nav in index and privacy policy all work now, thoughtfulHQ link is in
project should be good to ship.

1/06/2021
-update DNS Record (currently points to 69.73.159.23) A & CNAME *done
-add google analytics - gtag - done, just add outbound links *done
-update a href links to gatsby Link component for inward links * all are inward bare thoughtfulHQ (anything with href should be changed to Link)
-> Link doesnt do in-route navigation so navigate should be used instead -> navigate doesn't work either so I have to decide between functionality/cleaniss & performance
-> will just leave as is for style points/UI (downside being slower speed)

-Make sure SEO crawlers are working -> install sitemap *done -> install robots-txt * done (both could probably use more config but they're working)
https://frontend-digest.com/a-technical-guide-to-seo-with-gatsby-js-e88a7dac80f0 

-add gatsby-plugin-preload-fonts to stop font flicker on nav *done
-sitemap not being created -> siteURL in siteMetadata didn't have www. included
