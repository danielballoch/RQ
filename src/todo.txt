Next steps are 

1. adding footer content and theme * done
2. fixing grid background responsivness and making mobile friendly - created xd prototypes
*now I just need to figure out the break points and make the design shift for mobile. * responsive text for logo (not img) since less than 16px is illigible.

-fixed image size (added min height) - now make responsive - breakpoints, adobe xd draft

3. functionality (links, form)

4. optional could be downloading some royalty free images and recreating the hero and contact backgrounds? *done.


**** priority should be recreating background images since these need to be HD if they're blown up, keep the feel, make it look nice. Greyscale? *done

778 * 1024 switch to tablet/mobile.
